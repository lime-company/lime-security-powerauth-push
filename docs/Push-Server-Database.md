# Push Server Database

PowerAuth Push Server requires several database tables in order to work.

You can download DDL scripts for supported databases:

- [Oracle - Create Database Schema](./sql/oracle/create_push_server_schema.sql)
- [MySQL - Create Database Schema](./sql/mysql/create_push_server_schema.sql)

## Tables

- [Push service credentials](#push-service-credentials-table)
- [Push messages](#push-messages-table)
- [Push campaigns](#push-campaigns-table)
